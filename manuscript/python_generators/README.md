### OTHER PANELS:

All panels within Figs 5, 6, 9, 10, 11 (excepting Panel (a), which are three-dimensional representations) were created using the following command line code:

```
> python -m backmap -pdb <PDB_NAME>
```

All three dimensional representations were created using [VMD](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/) (Humphrey, W., Dalke, A. and Schulten, K., "VMD - Visual Molecular Dynamics", J. Molec. Graphics, 1996, vol. 14, pp. 33-38).
